<!--							<h2>Designation of the Controlled Area</h2>-->
<!--							-->
<!--							    <p>A plan of the MRI unit is shown in Appendix 1. Within the unit there exists a Controlled Area-->
<!--                                which totally encloses the 0.5 mT (5 Gauss) magnetic field contour. The extent of the controlled-->
<!--                                area is shown in Appendix 1.</p>-->
<!--                                -->
<!--                                <p>Access to the controlled area is through the Preparation Room, which is entered via a door with-->
<!--                                a security-coded lock to prevent unauthorised access.</p>-->
<!--                                -->
<!--                                <p>All unauthorised personnel including unauthorised staff and visitors must be screened and must-->
<!--                                be supervised by an authorised person at all times whilst within the controlled area (see Sections-->
<!--                                3 and 4). All objects and equipment must similarly be screened.</p>-->

<!--							<h2>Working Procedure: General RUles</h2>-->

<!--                                <p>No person or object must enter the controlled area without screening by an authorised person to ensure that entry is safe.</p>-->

<!--                                <p>These rules are in addition to and can be seen as an extension of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act. 1974 This clearly lays down the mandatory responsibilities and statutory requirements of the employer, employees and visitors who have access to the place of work.</p>-->
<!--                                <p>All the terms of the Act must be adhered to, including that persons must behave in a responsible and considerate manner in order not to endanger themselves or others and to maintain a good working atmosphere.</p>-->
<!--                                -->
<!--                                <p>Equipment must only be used by trained and competent personnel.</p>-->
<!--                                -->
<!--                                <p>Equipment must be properly used, serviced and maintained in a good state of repair. If faults-->
<!--occur that prevent normal safe operation of the equipment, the equipment must be taken out of service until repaired and passed fit for use. ALL faults must be reported and a record kept. The procedure for the reporting and documentation of faults must be followed (see Section 6).</p>-->

<!--                                <p>Working areas and exits should be kept clean, tidy and free from obstruction.</p>-->
<!--                                -->
<!--                                <p>Should the use of equipment produce an accident, near miss or hazardous situation, operation-->
<!--must cease immediately until the cause is investigated and the hazard is removed.</p>-->

<!--                                <p>An Accident/Incident Report Form must be completed without delay following any accident-->
<!--or hazardous situation. Copies of this form are kept in the Control Room. The incident should-->
<!--also be reported immediately to the MRI Safety Officer (see Appendix 2).</p>-->

<!--                                <p>In the event of an emergency such as fire, local procedures must be followed (see Section 5 and Appendix 6). All personnel should know the location of fire alarms and escape routes.</p>-->
